## Data Description
The data used for this exercise consists of used-vehicle transactions in the United States. This exercise is to review the provided transactions to determine which vehicles will command a higher price and, therefore, assist used car dealers in selecting inventory with the best prices on the market.

The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a vehicle more or less expensive. Based on our analysis, we will provide clear recommendations to used-car dealerships on what consumers value in a used car.



## General Findings

* 


## Opportunities

* Although the data gathered is intended for a population of drivers, it is vital to take into account pedestrian opportunities.
* Pedestrian traffic on the weekends is likely to provide greater coupon acceptance when people are looking for a place to go.
* Restricting to only drivers is limiting the audience artificially.
* There is no data in the observations regarding the day of the week. As can be seen from the data, those who are not in a hurry are more likely to accept the coupon. Identifying the day of the week will confirm the assumption that a lack of urgency creates an opportunity for coupon acceptance.
